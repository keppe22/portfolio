      <h3>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is John Keppe</h3>
      <p>a creative technologist with a knack for blending nostalgia with problem-solving. My journey spans a rich tapestry of rolesâ€”from streamlining university records and building digital inventory systems, to helping people save money as a trusted freelance tax preparer. I bring over six years of administrative and customer service experience, paired with a deep love for quirky retro UI and crisp data visualization.

Whether Iâ€™m troubleshooting code, polishing up pie charts, or designing Windows 95-style interfaces, I take pride in crafting experiences that are both functional and delightful. My background in history gives me a unique lens for storytelling, and Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to make the technical personal.

Letâ€™s just sayâ€”I donâ€™t believe in bland portfolios or boring interfaces. If it has pixelated icons, a system tray clock, and maybe even a cheeky assistant like Rover, Iâ€™m probably behind it..</p>
